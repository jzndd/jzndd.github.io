  title={Generalizing Consistency Policy to Visual RL with Prioritized Proximal Experience Regularization}, 
  author={Li, Haoran and Jiang, Zhennan and Chen, Yuhui and Zhao, Dongbin},
  journal={In The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS2024},
  abstract={With high-dimensional state spaces, visual reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in exploitation and exploration, resulting in low sample efficiency and training stability. As a time-efficient diffusion model, although consistency models have been validated in online state-based RL, it is still an open question whether it can be extended to visual RL. In this paper, we investigate the impact of non-stationary distribution and the actor-critic framework on consistency policy in online RL, and find that consistency policy was unstable during the training, especially in visual RL with the high-dimensional state space. To this end, we suggest sample-based entropy regularization to stabilize the policy training, and propose a consistency policy with prioritized proximal experience regularization (CP3ER) to improve sample efficiency. CP3ER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 21 tasks across DeepMind control suite and Meta-world. To our knowledge, CP3ER is the first method to apply diffusion/consistency models to visual RL and demonstrates the potential of consistency models in visual RL.},

  title={World4RL: Diffusion World Models for Policy Refinement with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation}, 
  author={Jiang, Zhennan and Liu, Kai and Qin, Yuxin and Tian, Shuai and Zheng, Yupeng and Zhou, Mingcai and Yu, Chao and Li, Haoran and Zhao, Dongbin},
  journal={Under Review},
  abstract={Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.},

  title={MARS-Sep: Multimodal-Aligned Reinforced Sound Separation}, 
  author={Zhang, Zihan and Cheng, Xize and Jiang, Zhennan and Fu, Dongjie and Chen, Jingyuan and Zhao, Zhou and Jin, Tao},
  journal={Under Review},
  abstract={Universal sound separation faces a fundamental misalignment: models optimized for low-level signal metrics often produce semantically contaminated outputs, failing to suppress perceptually salient interference from acoustically similar sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce MARS-Sep, a reinforcement learning framework that reformulates separation as decision making. Instead of simply regressing ground-truth masks, MARS-Sep learns a factorized Beta mask policy that is optimized by a clipped trust-region surrogate with entropy regularization and group-relative advantage normalization. Concretely, we sample masks from a frozen old policy, reconstruct waveforms, and update the current policy using clipped importance ratios-yielding substantially more stable and sample-efficient learning. Multimodal rewards, derived from an audio-text-vision encoder, directly incentivize semantic consistency with query prompts. We further propose a progressive alignment scheme to fine-tune this encoder, boosting its cross-modal discriminability and improving reward faithfulness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in Text-, Audio-, and Image-Queried separation, with notable improvements in signal metrics and semantic quality.},

  title={TeViR: Text-to-Video Reward with Diffusion Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning}, 
  author={Chen, Yuhui and Li, Haoran and Jiang, Zhennan and Wen, Haowei and Zhao, Dongbin},
  journal={Under Review},
  abstract={Developing scalable and generalizable reward engineering for reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for creating general-purpose agents, especially in the challenging domain of robotic manipulation. While recent advances in reward engineering with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise, their sparse reward nature significantly limits sample efficiency. This paper introduces TeViR, a novel method that leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to generate dense rewards by comparing the predicted image sequence with current observations. Experimental results across 11 complex robotic tasks demonstrate that TeViR outperforms traditional methods leveraging sparse rewards and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving better sample efficiency and performance without ground truth environmental rewards. TeViR’s ability to efficiently guide agents in complex environments highlights its potential to advance reinforcement learning applications in robotic manipulation.},

  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
