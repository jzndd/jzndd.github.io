Welcome! I'm Zhennan Jiang (江震南), a first-year Ph.D. student in Technology for Computer Applications at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CASIA](https://ia.cas.cn/)). I am fortunate to have [Prof. Dongbin Zhao](https://ia.cas.cn/rcdw/yjy/202404/t20240422_7129930.html) (IEEE Fellow) as my chief supervisor, alongside [Dr. Haoran Li](https://ia.cas.cn/rcdw/fyjy/202404/t20240422_7129926.html) as my co-supervisor. I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Central South University. Currently, I am also undergoing joint training at Zhongguancun Academy, under the mentorship of [Prof. Chao Yu](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/ChaoYu).

My research interests currently focus on reinforcement learning and robotics.
